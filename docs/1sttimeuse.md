Connect the power adaptor to the terraPen controller (located under the base board) by lifting up the front of the machine. 

When power is applied, the machine automatically powers on. On first use, you will be able to connect to it via Wi-Fi and your device will appear in the list of available Wi-Fi networks on your device as “terraPen”.  

Connect using password 12345678. 

On Windows, a browser will open to the terraPen User Interface (UI), on macOS, a Captive Portal will open. 

For full control it is recommended to connect via a browser and going to 

* http://terrapen.local 

or 

* http://192.168.0.1 

From the UI Dashboard you can jog the pen carriage, and zero the machine axis using the Controls panel. 
Layout and orientation can change depending on device and screen size.
