The firmware running terraPen is [FluidNC](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC) - and has had configurations defined for use with the terraPen which are saved as a .yaml file.

Each toolhead configuration requires its accompanying YAML file which can be sourced from our [GitHub](https://github.com/theworkisthework/fluidnc-config-files).

Settings such as Acceleration and Feedrate can be configured in this file and uploaded to the terraPen flash memory. 

The terraPen has all YAML files pre-loaded and is assigned accordingly to match the toolhead installed.
